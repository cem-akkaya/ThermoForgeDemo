## Overview

Thermo Forge is an Unreal Engine plugin for simulating and querying heat, climate, and thermal conditions in your levels.
It processes baked geometry fields such as sky openness, wall permeability, and indoor factors, then blends them with dynamic weather, altitude, and heat sources to produce realistic temperature values anywhere in the world.

The system is built around Thermo Forge Volumes and Heat Source Components, with a World Subsystem handling queries and composition. You can work directly with baked fields, introduce runtime sources, or retrieve composed temperatures through both Blueprints and C++.

Thermo Forge is designed for seamless gameplay integration, from AI “heat sense” behaviors to environment-driven mechanics. It is efficient, editor-friendly, and requires no engine modifications or physics assets. Instead, it models environmental interaction through the concept of porosity, the relationship between material volume and surrounding space. This is used to approximate permeability and how heat dissipates or propagates in real-world conditions.

The system is baked and lightweight, relying on precomputed fields for efficiency while applying runtime adjustments for climate, diurnal cycles, elevation, and occlusion. Dynamic heat sources remain fully interactive, enabling believable changes such as a fire cooling its surroundings when extinguished.

Thermo Forge is still under development but has been proven stable in both open-world and smaller test environments. It has been validated with multiple overlapping volumes, dense grids, and complex level layouts. While experimental in nature, it is carefully designed, tested, and refined with the aid of AI supervision to ensure clarity, code quality, and reliability.

## What can I do with this plugin?

- **Environmental VFX** : Show shimmer particles above hot spots, frosty breath in cold pockets, or add post-process effects that lerp emissive/outline by (Temp − Ambient).
- **Status effects** : Trigger “Overheat” in >X °C areas (stagger, bloom, accuracy penalty) or “Comfort” near heat sources (stamina regen). Cold zones can slow reload but quiet footsteps for stealth.
- **Environmental puzzles & roguelite hooks** : Heat locks that open only above a threshold, ice bridges by chilling pipes, or time-of-day rooms flipping hot/cold for route planning choices.
- **Source/field synergies** : Use baked permeability for insulation gameplay: reduced heat damage behind thick walls, or explosive blasts venting down leaky corridors.
- **Elemental weapons** : Fire weapons spawn short-lived +°C bubbles, cryo weapons spawn −°C fields that suppress enemy thermal sense and fire-rate. Mods can alter falloff (Linear / None / InverseSquare) to reshape crowd control.
- **Faction and creature traits** : “Heat predators” track targets through smoke but struggle in uniformly hot rooms, while other AI can use thermal cues as senses you can disrupt.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>From which gameplay objects can I query temperature?</b></summary>

> From any world position. You don’t need to attach a component to the object.  
> You can query directly from the Thermo Forge Subsystem or spawn a helper actor with a Heat Source component if you want to contribute new thermal data.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How accurate are the thermal calculations?</b></summary>

> Accuracy depends on the grid cell size of your Thermo Forge Volumes and the preview/bake settings.  
> For most gameplay purposes (AI senses, survival mechanics, ambient temperature), the results are stable and believable.  
> The system is designed for performance and consistency, not exact thermodynamics simulation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does Thermo Forge simulate full thermodynamics?</b></summary>

> No. Thermo Forge is not a scientific thermodynamics solver.  
> It is a hybrid approach: baked geometry fields plus runtime adjustments (climate, altitude, weather, and heat sources).  
> This makes it extremely fast and reliable for gameplay without heavy CPU/GPU load.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I add or remove heat sources at runtime?</b></summary>

> Yes. Heat Source Components can be attached or destroyed at runtime.  
> They automatically register with the Subsystem and immediately affect queries.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How efficient is it in large open-world levels?</b></summary>

> Very efficient.  
> Baking is done once per volume and stored in lightweight field assets.  
> Runtime queries are O(1) lookups into the nearest grid cell with minor adjustments.  
> It scales well with multiple volumes, even in large environments.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it require physics assets or engine modifications?</b></summary>

> No. Thermo Forge uses standard Unreal tracing and materials.  
> It does not depend on physics assets or engine modifications.  
> It can be dropped into any project as a self-contained plugin.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can AI use Thermo Forge for “heat sense” behaviors?</b></summary>

> Yes. You can query the subsystem in AI controllers or behavior trees.  
> This enables AI to detect players or objects by heat signature instead of only vision.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do altitude and weather affect results?</b></summary>

> Altitude reduces temperature using the environmental lapse rate.  
> Weather controls solar gain and affects how much heat from the sky reaches a location.  
> Both are configurable in Project Settings.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I preview heat values in the editor?</b></summary>

> Yes. Thermo Forge Volumes support grid previews and colored heat visualization.  
> Use the tab menu or volume details panel to rebuild, show, or hide previews.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is the system multiplayer/replication ready?</b></summary>

> Thermo Forge itself runs on the server side by default.  
> Query results can be passed to clients like any other gameplay data.  
> Heat Sources are just components, so their replication depends on the owning actor.
</details>

## Planned  Upcoming Features
